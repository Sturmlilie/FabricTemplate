# Fabric Example Mod

## Customize template

`template_strings.src` contains every parameter + instructions.

After the parameters are set, run `init_template.sh` to apply them.  
A few things this will also do:
* Renames the main entrypoint file/class to "Main.java"
* Deletes the example mixins (not every mod needs mixins)

## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.
